# CryptoClustering Challenge

This repository contains my work for the 19th challenge of the UofT SCS edX Data Bootcamp.

## Background

The goal of this challenge is to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes, using Python and unsupervised machine learning.

## Summary

This challenge was completed using unsupervised learning and the k-means algorithm to determine how best to cluster the data. After reading in the dataset into a pandas dataframe, the data was normalized using the `StandardScaler` module. Using the elbow method, the best value for `k` was found to proceed with the k-means model. After fitting the model using the scaled data and predicting the clusters, a scatter plot was generated using `hvplot` to visualize the clusters.

The clusters were then optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by reducing the dataset's features to three principal components, accounting for 89% of the variance within the data. Employing the elbow method again, the best value for `k` was found and a second k-means model was initialized and fitted to predict the new clusters. From there, another scatter plot was generated to visualize the optimized clusters.
